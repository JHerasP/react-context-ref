# React-context-ref
Example about how to create a react context with useRef.
The example contains a simple proyect structure with counters to watch how many times each component renders.

The expected resoult of using a this context is that only the input writing / reading the context will be renderized when modified. The rest of the component tree should be intact.

For a better experience, install React Developer Tools for the browser and use *"Highlight updates when components render"*.

# Launch
Install the proyect with: 
```
npm install
```
And start it with:
```
npm run dev 
```
